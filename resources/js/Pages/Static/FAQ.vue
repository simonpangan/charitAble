                                        The main focus of this platform is to ease barriers in giving of donors and volunteers, through solving concerns such as transparency and communication. With the advanced features and tools provided by CharitAble, the following may benefit from the study.
                                        <br />

                                        <span class="fw-bold">Charity -</span> The new platform can serve as complementary with their already existing platforms, such as social media, intending to fill in the gaps that social media has left unresolved in resolving barriers in giving. One of the key issues the pandemic has brought to charitable institutions is a significant drop in funding that threatens to affect programs and services supporting vulnerable people in our society. CharitAble intends to ease the barriers in giving, potentially inspire and retain more donors thus a more likely of receiving higher funding from donations, as well as increasing productivity and interaction from inspired volunteers. The platform also intends to promote a level of greater transparency among the charity and donor in metrics such as capacity, timeline and funds, thus developing more healthy expectations for all parties.

                                        <span class="fw-bold">Volunteers -</span> The result of the study would help them in searching for organizations that they would like to volunteer with. They can check out the page profile of the charity, taking in mind the charitable institution's mission and vision if it aligns with them. The proposed platform also provides a job-search like feature wherein charities could post volunteer posting, noting the required skills, traits, moreover if the volunteering work is remote and is open for volunteers without any prior experience. This feature is useful as volunteers highlighted issues such as the lack of awareness on the available volunteering opportunities and hesitancy from information barriers if charities accept volunteers without any prior experience and skills.

                                        <span class="fw-bold">Donors -</span> The proposed solution of CharitAble intends to further link donors and charities towards a closer and productive relationship, collaborating to achieve common goals. Most donors want transparency and openness from charitable institutions, as they could not easily determine a charity's trustworthiness and credibility, some charitable institutions do not always explain what the program would be and how the funds will be used. This fuels distrust between the delicate charity-donor relationship. Donors could benefit from a blockchain powered transaction wherein they can access secured and tamper-proof public receipt or records of transactions done by the charitable institutions, through this feature it would promote transparency and a higher degree of trust towards the charitable institutions.

                                        Studies found that donors have several concerns that affect their personal experiences with charitable giving, with transparency being the most important issue and lack of information and better interaction are other concerns. The lack of transparency by charities on how the donations are used affect charitable giving by donors as they want greater insights into the impact of their giving so that they will donate more. On the other hand, charity interaction affects donors giving as they want more acknowledgment and better communication. Lastly, lack of information about charities is also an issue as few donors indicate they have trouble finding new nonprofits to support. The same goes with the volunteers,  volunteers wanted to learn more about the volunteer possibilities offered by nonprofit organizations, which might lead to increased giving.
                                        Moreover, v olunteers are uneasy from a series of concerns such as lack of volunteering opportunities, and whether they have the right skills, qualities and experience for it. Moreover, volunteers wished to know  more about the potential of their positive contribution, thus fulfilling their motivation to start volunteering for charitable institutions.

                                        The researchers also provided online surveys to 102 respondents on Metro Manila to validate current barriers of giving within the local context, however due to time constraints there is a noticeable lack of older/senior bracket respondents, hence this could potentially affect the perceived benefits of the system as they play a big role in providing towards charities. Additionally the survey is also used to discover the perceived potential benefits of the CharitAble features and functionalities in removing the barriers of giving. There are also 4 non-profit organizations/charity respondents that have given their insights in regards to barriers of giving.

                                        In order for charities to solicit donations through our platform, they must apply for a verification status by submitting required documents. The two primary required documents are SEC Articles of Incorporation, to determine if an organization is registered  as a legal non profit organization entity. This particular document could be validated using the SEC Express System to determine its authenticity. Another document required by our platform is the DSWD Solicitation Permit, this document provides non-profit organizations legality to solicit donations for its programs. Every  application  for a solicitation permit requires thorough checking of the organization program planning and management, manually by the admins of CharitAble,. Both  of these documents ensure that the donors are donating their hard earned money to legitimate organizations with efficient financial management and detailed planning while minimizing the risk of any fraud or scams. Unverified charities could still use all the features and functionalities of the platform with the exception of donation solicitation.
